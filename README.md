# SortXml
This is an assignment for a job interview. Got a link to an xml file and was asked to create a page that read and present the contents of the file and to also make the result sort-able on price or name by sorting the xml.

​I heavily made use of bootstrap for the presentation. I have little experience with xml or xml functions. This was a nice little challenge​.

Project has a gulpfile but didn't use it in any way, more like a standard project starting reflex.
