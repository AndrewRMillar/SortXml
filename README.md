# SortXml
This is an assignment for a job interview. Got a link to an xml file and was asked to substrack and present the contents of the file and to also make the result sortable on price or name by sorting the xml.
Heavy use of bootstrap for the presentatoin. I have little experiance with xml or xml functions, more used to JSON eventhough JSON isn't sortable, you sort the result.
